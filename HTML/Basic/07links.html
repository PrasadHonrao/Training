    <h4>First specifications</h4>

        The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",
        first mentioned on the Internet by Berners-Lee in late 1991.[5][6] It describes
        18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for
        the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house SGML
        based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML
        4.[7]

        HyperText Markup Language is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret
        and compose text, images and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default
        characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these
        characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional
        use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report
        TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text
        formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early
        1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting
        commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents.
        However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated
        ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation
        of structure and processing; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction
        with CSS.

        Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined
        as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication
        of the first proposal for an HTML specification: "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)"
        Internet-Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document
        Type Definition to define the grammar.[8] The draft expired after six months, but
        was notable for its acknowledgement of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for
        embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on
        successful prototypes.[9] Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+
        (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented
        features like tables and fill-out forms.[10]

        After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML
        Working Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification
        intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should
        be based.[9] Published as Request for Comments 1866, – Introduction|publisher=Internet
        Engineering Task Force|month=November|year=1995|accessdate=1 December 2010|quote=This
        document thus defines an HTML 2.0 (to distinguish it from the previous informal
        specifications). Future (generally upwardly compatible) versions of HTML with new
        features will be released with higher version numbers.}}</ref>
    </p>

        Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests.
        Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial
        software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[11] However, in 2000,
        HTML also became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published
        in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004 development began
        on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which
        became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008.
